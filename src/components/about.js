            Hello! I recently graduated from the University of North Carolina at
            Charlotte with a degree in computer science focusing in software
            engineering and a minor in mathematics. Take a look at my{" "}

          <p>
            My experience includes working as a teachers assistant for Girls Who
            Code, where I helped teach highschool students various programming
            languages, some of which included Python, Javascript, HTML and CSS.
            Also, during my time at UNCC, I held mentoring positions for
            students in introductory computer science courses and for students
            who where underperforming academically.

            I am enthusiastic about learning web technologies and prepared to
            take on new challenges. When I am not coding you can find me
            spending my free time drawing or playing video games with friends.
          </p>
